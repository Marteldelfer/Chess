# Chess
A chess app using python 3 and kivy. The main focus is to create a functional chess game, but if there's enough time, i would like to create an AI to play chess. If that's too big of a task, i may be able to use stockfish, but i think it would be hard to integrate. Still, the AI is completely optional.
